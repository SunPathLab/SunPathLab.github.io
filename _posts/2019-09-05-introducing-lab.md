### Research
The Sun lab innovates computational algorithms to quantify and model intra tumor heterogeneity (ITH) from next generation sequencing (NGS) data, and leverages patterns of ITH to statistically infer the kinetics of cancer. 

* `Quantifying ITH`: We develop statistical methods to achieve a bias-minimized, high-fidelity quantification of (epi)genomic ITH from tumor sequencing data. Such data involve tissue sampling at increasing granularity, i.e., single bulk, longitudinal, multi-region, and single cell sampling. Both genomic ITH (copy number, structural and small variants) and epigenetic ITH (expression level, chromatin states) are of our interest. <!-- Example: [VAP](https://combine-lab.github.io/VAP/) -->
* `Modelling ITH`: We use mathematical and computational models to interpret the observed ITH from patient data. Hypotheses regarding genome instability, clonal dynamics and tumor microenvironments are tested by comparing ITH between the model and patient data. By learning patient specific model parameters, we increase ITH's explanatory value for tumor dynamics as well as its predictive power for tumor evolvability.

As an emerging field that encourages interdisciplinary cooperation, we maintain vigorous cooperative research projects with clinicians, biologists, mathematicians, engineers, and physicists to bridge the scales among (epi)genetic variations, cellular behavior and tumor tissue patterns.
