### Research
As a geneticist and computational biologist, my research is  and leverage patterns of ITH to infer the evolutionary dynamics of human cancers. 

The Sun Lab innovate computational algorithms in quantifying, decomposing and modeling Genomic Tumor Heterogeneity.
The Heterogeneity can be measured between spatially and/or longitudinally collected tumor samples, across the full
spectrum of somatic alterations at genetic level (Copy Number, Structural and small variants) using DNA-seq and
epigenetic level using RNA-seq and ATAC-seq technologies.
Our aim is to translate Heterogeneity measures into biologically and evolutionary meaningful parameters,
and to establish reliable connections between these measures and tumor aggressiveness. 

* High resolution and fidelity in measuring (epi)genetic variation is the foundation of precision cancer genomics.
  Bioinformatic innovations to improve the detection and quantification of intra tumor heterogeneity (ITH) from next generation sequencing (NGS) data,

* Modelling 
* We develop, support, and maintain the
  [DESeq2](http://bioconductor.org/packages/DESeq2) package
  for statistical analysis of RNA-seq and other sequencing experiments,
  and associated packages and workflows for analyzing genomics
  data. See the [Software](pages/software.html) tab for more details.

### PI - Background

During my research tenure, I have developed considerable expertise in algorithm design and statistical analysis of (epi)genetic data, as well as in the computational modelling of cancer, such as gene regulatory circuits and cellular automata models. My unique experiences and quantitative training have enabled me to conduct impactful research at the interface of cancer genomics, computational and systems biology. My goal is to continue to develop algorithms and computational methods that advance a mechanistic understanding of tumor evolution and that are accessible and broadly utilized by the cancer biology community. Before joining UMN, I was an Instructor in `Stanford Cancer Institute (Curtis lab)`. From 2013-2015, I was a postdoc in the `Califano Lab in the Department of Systems Biology` at Columbia University. From 2009-2013, I was a Research Fellow in the `Vingron Department in Computational Molecular Biology` at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin. I completed a Ph.D. in Genetics (2009) at Fudan University in Shanghai.
