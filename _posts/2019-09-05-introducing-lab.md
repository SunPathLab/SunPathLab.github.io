### Research
The Sun lab innovates computational algorithms to quantify and model intra tumor heterogeneity (ITH) from next generation sequencing (NGS) data, and leverages patterns of ITH to statistically infer the dynamics of cancer. 

* `Quantifying ITH`: ITH is measured from tumor samples with increasing granularity, including single bulk, multi-region, longitudinal, and single cell sampling. The measurements can be at both genomic level (copy number, structural and small variants) using DNA-seq and epigenetic level (expression level, chromatin states) using e.g., RNA-seq and ATAC-seq datasets. We develop statistical methods to achieve a bias-minimized, high fidelity quantification of (epi)genomic ITH from these data. <!-- Example: [VAP](https://combine-lab.github.io/VAP/) -->
* `Modelling ITH`: We use mathematical and computational models to interpret the observed ITH from patient data. Hypotheses regarding genome instability, clonal dynamics and tumor microenvironments are tested by comparing ITH between the model and patient data. By learning patient specific model parameters, we increase ITH's explanatory value for tumor dynamics as well as its predictive power for tumor aggressiveness.
