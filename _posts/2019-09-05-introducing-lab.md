### Research
The Sun lab innovates computational algorithms to quantify and model intra tumor heterogeneity (ITH) from next generation sequencing (NGS) data, and leverages patterns of ITH to statistically infer the evolutionary dynamics of human cancers. ITH can be measured between spatially and/or longitudinally collected tumor samples, at both genetic level (copy number, structural and small variants) from DNA-seq and epigenetic level from RNA-seq or ATAC-seq datasets. Our aim is to translate ITH measures into biologically meaningful parameters, and to establish reliable connections between these measures and tumor aggressiveness. 

* High resolution and fidelity in measuring (epi)genetic variation is the foundation of precision cancer genomics.

* Modelling ITH. See the [Software](pages/software.html) tab for more details.

### PI - Background

During my research tenure, I have developed considerable expertise in algorithm design and statistical analysis of (epi)genetic data, as well as in the computational modelling of cancer, such as gene regulatory circuits and cellular automata models. My unique experiences and quantitative training have enabled me to conduct impactful research at the interface of cancer genomics, computational and systems biology. My goal is to continue to develop algorithms and computational methods that advance a mechanistic understanding of tumor evolution and that are accessible and broadly utilized by the cancer biology community. Before joining UMN, I was an Instructor in `Stanford Cancer Institute (Curtis lab)`. From 2013-2015, I was a postdoc in the `Califano Lab in the Department of Systems Biology` at Columbia University. From 2009-2013, I was a Research Fellow in the `Vingron Department in Computational Molecular Biology` at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin. I completed a Ph.D. in Genetics (2009) at Fudan University in Shanghai.
