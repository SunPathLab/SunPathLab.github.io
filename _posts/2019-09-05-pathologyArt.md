Our lab is affiliated with the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. We maintain vigorous cooperative research projects with pathologists, biologists, and mathematicians to bridge the scales among genomic variations, cellular behavior and tumor tissue patterns.

[//]: # ### Research

[//]: # * `Quantifying ITH`: We develop statistical methods to achieve a bias-minimized, high-fidelity quantification of (epi)genomic ITH from tumor sequencing data. Such data involve tissue sampling at increasing granularity, i.e., single bulk, longitudinal, multi-region, and single cell sampling. Both genomic ITH (copy number, structural and small variants) and epigenetic ITH (expression level, chromatin states) are of our interest. <!-- Example: [VAP](https://combine-lab.github.io/VAP/) -->
[//]: # * `Modelling ITH`: We use mathematical and computational models to interpret the observed ITH from patient data. Hypotheses regarding genome instability, clonal dynamics and tumor microenvironments are tested by comparing ITH between the model and patient data. By learning patient specific model parameters, we increase ITH's explanatory value for tumor dynamics as well as its predictive power for tumor evolvability.
