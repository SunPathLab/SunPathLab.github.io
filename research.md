We innovate computational algorithms to quantify and model tumor heterogeneity (TH) from next generation sequencing (NGS) data, and leverages patterns of TH to statistically infer the kinetics of cancer.

**_Tumor Clonal Dynamics_**: we perform `data driven modeling` of single-cell based spatial tumor growth, to reveal the principles that govern the relation between genomic heterogeneity, clonal dynamics, and sequencing detectability of somatic variants.

**_Analytics in Tumor Heterogeneity_**: We push the limits in computational methods to achieve a high-fidelity quantification of (epi)genomic heterogeneity from tumor sequencing data (including CNA, SV, SNV, Gene Expression etc). Biases are inescapable but can be informative when we understand them better.

**_Visualizing Genomic Heterogeneity_**: We develop visualization tools to reveal the patterns of tumor heterogeneity, faciliate feature extraction and inspire sicentific reasoning.

[//]: # * `Quantifying ITH`:  Both genomic ITH (copy number, structural and small variants) and epigenetic ITH (expression level, chromatin states) are of our interest. <!-- Example: [VAP](https://combine-lab.github.io/VAP/) -->
[//]: # * `Modelling ITH`: We use mathematical and computational models to interpret the observed ITH from patient data. Hypotheses regarding genome instability, clonal dynamics and tumor microenvironments are tested by comparing ITH between the model and patient data. By learning patient specific model parameters, we increase ITH's explanatory value for tumor dynamics as well as its predictive power for tumor evolvability.

[//]: # As an emerging field that encourages interdisciplinary cooperation, we maintain vigorous cooperative research projects with clinicians, biologists, mathematicians, engineers, and physicists to bridge the scales among (epi)genetic variations, cellular behavior and tumor tissue patterns.
